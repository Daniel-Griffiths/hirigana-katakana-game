## React Hiragana Game

A simple game built in React to help learn [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana). 

I created this game to help myself revise Hiragana (in preparation to a trip to Japan ðŸ˜Ž). I found this flash card style approuch to learning to be a very helpful way to memorise the characters, especially ones with a [dakuten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakuten_and_handakuten) which can be hard to remeber.
